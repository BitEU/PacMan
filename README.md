# üéÆ PacMan in Pure Batch

A fully functional PacMan game implemented entirely in Windows Batch scripting! This project demonstrates the incredible capabilities of batch scripting by recreating the classic arcade game using only native Windows commands.

## üåü Features

- **Pure Batch Implementation**: Written entirely in Windows Batch (.bat) files
- **Full Game Mechanics**: 
  - Player movement with WASD controls
  - Ghost AI with different behaviors
  - Pellet collection and scoring
  - Power pellets that make ghosts vulnerable
  - Three difficulty levels (Easy, Normal, Hard)
- **Visual Effects**: 
  - Colorful ASCII graphics
  - Animated characters
  - Real-time score display
  - Game over screen
- **Advanced Batch Techniques**:
  - ANSI escape sequences for colors and positioning
  - Delayed variable expansion
  - Complex string manipulation
  - Multi-process architecture (separate control and game processes)

## üéØ How to Play

1. **Run the Game**: Double-click `pacman.bat` or run it from the command line
2. **Select Difficulty**: 
   - Press `A` for Easy
   - Press `B` for Normal  
   - Press `C` for Hard
3. **Controls**:
   - `W` - Move Up
   - `A` - Move Left
   - `S` - Move Down
   - `D` - Move Right
4. **Objective**: 
   - Collect all the small pellets (‚Ä¢) to score points
   - Eat power pellets (‚óã) to temporarily make ghosts vulnerable
   - Avoid the ghosts (unless they're vulnerable)
   - Try to achieve the highest score possible!

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows operating system
- Command Prompt or PowerShell
- No additional software required!

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/BitEU/PacMan.git
   cd PacMan
   ```

2. Run the game:
   ```powershell
   .\pacman.bat
   ```

## üé® Technical Highlights

This implementation showcases advanced batch scripting techniques:

- **ANSI Color Support**: Uses ANSI escape sequences for colorful graphics
- **Real-time Input**: Implements non-blocking input handling
- **Game Loop**: Maintains consistent frame timing
- **Collision Detection**: Handles wall and ghost collisions
- **AI Behavior**: Ghosts have different movement patterns
- **State Management**: Tracks game state, scores, and ghost modes

## üéÆ Game Elements

- **Player (‚ñà)**: Yellow Pac-Man character
- **Ghosts (‚ñì)**: 
  - Blinky (Red)
  - Inky (Cyan) 
  - Pinky (Pink)
  - Clyde (Orange)
- **Pellets (‚Ä¢)**: Small dots worth 10 points each
- **Power Pellets (‚óã)**: Large dots worth 50 points, make ghosts vulnerable
- **Walls (‚ñà)**: Blue maze boundaries

## üèÜ Scoring

- Small pellets: 10 points each
- Power pellets: 50 points each
- Eating vulnerable ghosts: 200 points each

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Structure

- **Main Game Loop**: Handles player input, ghost movement, and collision detection
- **Map Creation**: Dynamically generates the game maze
- **Control System**: Separate process for handling user input
- **Graphics Engine**: ANSI escape sequence-based rendering system
